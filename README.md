# Shark Attack Project

CLEANING DATA, PYTHON, PANDAS, SEABORN, MATPLOTLIB.

Project made to train some skills learned in class:

- Data Cleaning
- Plotting Graphs
- Do some questions to the data

## Data Cleaning

- Dropping nonsense structures.
- Using Regex to Filter data.
- Do a Unique question, and answer it with the data.

## Pipeline Followed in Jupyter notebook:

- Importing Libraries
- Reading the file
- Transforming the values to work with them
- Cleaning some columns
- Saving to csv
- The first thought: I was thinking that the most provoked sharks were the most who killed, but it isn't here is the analysis to conclude this.
- The thesis: what is the riskiest activity 
- Conclusion 

## Conclusion 

From 1423 attacks, we can see in the following bar charts
