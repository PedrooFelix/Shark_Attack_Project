CLEANING DATA WITH PYTHON, PANDAS, SEABORN, MATPLOTLIB.

Project made to train some skills learned in class:

1- Dropping nonsense structures.
2- Using Regex to Filter data.
3- Do a Unique question, and answer it with the data.

## Pipeline Followed in Jupyter notebook:

1- Importing Libraries
2- Reading the file
3- Transforming the values to work with them
4- Cleaning some columns
5- The first thought: I was thinking that the most provoked sharks were the most who killed, but it isn't here is the analysis to conclude this.
